            <h3>PLACE I</h3>
            <p>Zamboanga Zamboanga is my favorite place because I have many friends there and I’ve made a lot of unforgettable memories. Aside from that, there are so many beautiful spots to visit and fun places to explore.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>FOOD II</h3>
            <p>Ground Pork (Giniling na Baboy) My favorite food is ground pork because it’s simple, flavorful, and reminds me of home. I love how it can be cooked in many ways—whether with potatoes, carrots, or just with soy sauce and spices. It’s comforting and always hits the spot, especially when eaten with rice.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>COLOR III</h3>
            <p> Black is my favorite color because it’s classic, elegant, and goes well with everything. It gives off a strong and confident vibe, and I love how it can be both simple and powerful at the same time.</p>
