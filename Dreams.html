        <p>Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of becoming a flight attendant. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of traveling the world, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures. The thought of flying high in the sky while serving passengers with a smile inspired me. My passion for travel, along with my love for stylish uniforms and excellent customer service, continues to fuel my ambition to become a professional flight attendant.</p>

        <h1 class="page-title">HOUSE</h1>
        <p class="dark">I imagine my dream house as a spacious and elegant home with a stunning view. It will have a swimming pool inside the house, offering both relaxation and luxury. The place will be peaceful, beautiful, and filled with everything I need—a perfect sanctuary to rest and enjoy life.</p>
